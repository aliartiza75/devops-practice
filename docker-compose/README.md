"This is a basic Nginx setup using Docker Compose. The nginx service pulls the latest Nginx image, maps HTTP and HTTPS ports, and mounts volumes for configuration files, static HTML, logs, and SSL certificates. I've defined a custom bridge network to allow inter-container communication if needed later. Restart policy is set to always, ensuring resilience. This setup allows for scalable, portable local development or lightweight production environments with version-controlled configuration."
